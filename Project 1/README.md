**Name :** Project 1

**Objectives :** This project has the following objectives

1. Use an assembler (ASM51) and simulator (EdSim51) for the 8051 microcontroller to write a basic assembly program
1. Use WinCUPL to write code and program SPLDs
1. Layout planning for your board
1. Basic board setup including power connectors, voltage regulator, POWER ON LED, power switch, wire wrap sockets, microcontroller, reset circuitry, oscillators, pull up resistors, SPLD, lach, and RS-232 connector.

**Tools :** This project uses an assembler, simulator, SPLD programming software and KiCAD for schematic capture
