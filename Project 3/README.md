**Name :** Project 3

**Objectives :** This project has the following objectives

1. Add RS-232 communication hardware to your exisiting board using MAX232 IC
1. Write device drivers for serial communication over RS-232
1. Write code to use internal XRAM and external XRAM
1. Initialize the hardware using C code
1. Use a logic analyzer to capture state and timing information
1. Implement a debug circuit using a latch
1. Setup PAULMON as a on chip debugger
1. Design a virtual debug port

**Tools :** This project uses an SDCC C compiler, WinCUPL SPLD programming software and KiCAD for schematic capture
