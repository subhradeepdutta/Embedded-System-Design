**Name :** Project 2

**Objectives :** This project has the following objectives

1. Add decoding logic based on your memory map and a NVRAM for code storage
1. Test NVRAM accesses and perform user I/O
1. Use the 8051 timers and write ISRs in assembly
1. Use a device programmer for code storage
1. Use a logic analyzer to capture state and timing information
1. Implement a debug circuit using a latch

**Tools :** This project uses an assembler, simulator, SPLD programming software and KiCAD for schematic capture
